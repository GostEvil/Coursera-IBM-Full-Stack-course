### Phases of Software Development Lifecycle - SDLC

Planning

- SRS - Software Requirements Specification are:
  - Gathered
  - Analyzed
  - Documented
  - Priotized

Design

- SRS to develop architecure

Development

- Coding

Testing

- Code is tested to ensure stability, security and that it meets requirements from srs
- Bugs reported, racked, fixed and retestet

Deployment

- Code realesed to production environment

Maintance

- Stakeholder feedback, issues/bugs identified, code enhancements suggested

### Building Quality Software

User Acceptence Testing (UAT) or Beta testing

**Realeases**  
Alpha

- Select stakeholders
- May conain errors
- Design changes may occur

Beta

- Alla stakeholders
- User testing
- Meet requirements

General Availability

- Stable
- All users

### Software Versions

**What do version numbers mean?**
e.g.: version 9.1.33.6

- 1st number(9) indicates major changes, such as a new realese
- 2nd number(1) indicates minor changes
- 3rd number(33) indicates patches or minor bug fixes
- 4th number(6) indicates build number, dates and less sognificant changes

Backwards-compatible software functions properly with older versio of files, programs and system

### Summary & Highlights

Software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software.

Responsibilities of a software engineer include designing, building, and maintaining software systems.

Using the SDLC can improve efficiency and reduce risks by:

- letting team members know what they should be working on and when
- facilitating communication between the customer, other stakeholders, and the development team
- letting stakeholders know where they fit into that process and
- letting cross-domain teams know when they have completed their tasks so development can move to the next phase.

Common software engineering processes are requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, releasing, and documenting.

The requirement gathering process entails identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and objectives, eliciting requirements from the stakeholders, documenting the requirements, analyzing, prioritizing, and confirming the requirements.

An SRS is a document that captures the functionalities that the software should perform and also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance.

A URS is a subset of the SRS that details user specification requirements.

The SysRS contains the same information as an SRS, but can also additionally include system capabilities, interfaces, and user characteristics, policy requirements, regulation requirements, personnel requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, and system acceptance criteria.

Waterfall, V-shape model, and agile are all different methodologies for implementing the software development life cycle.

Functional testing is concerned with inputs and corresponding outputs of the system under test, non-functional testing tests for attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and availability. Whereas regression testing confirms that a recent change to the application, such as a bug fix, does not adversely affect already existing functionality.

Types of documentation include requirements, design, technical, quality assurance, and user.

There are many different roles involved in a software engineering project. Some of them include project manager or scrum master, stakeholder, system or software architect, UX designer, software developer, tester or QA engineer, site reliability or Ops engineer, product manager or owner, and technical writer or information developer.
